# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| `main` branch | Active development |
| Tagged releases | Critical fixes backported |
| Older releases | No longer supported |

VineOS is pre-1.0. Once 1.0 is released, this policy will be updated to
cover the current stable release and the previous minor version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report security issues privately via GitHub's security advisory feature:

**[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/Hexadecinull/VineOS/security/advisories/new)**

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce, with affected Android version and device model if relevant
- Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots
- A suggested fix if you have one

## Response Timeline

| Step | Target time |
|------|-------------|
| Acknowledgement | 48 hours |
| Initial assessment | 5 business days |
| Fix for critical issues | 7 days |
| Fix for moderate issues | 30 days |
| Public disclosure | After fix is released |

## Scope

In scope:

- Container namespace escape (guest process reaching the host filesystem or processes)
- QEMU binfmt_misc misconfiguration enabling arbitrary code execution on the host
- VineRuntime JNI vulnerabilities allowing privilege escalation
- ROM download integrity bypass (SHA-256 verification)
- VineService foreground service abuse

Out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities requiring physical device access
- Issues in upstream dependencies (QEMU, AOSP); report those upstream instead
- Theoretical vulnerabilities with no practical exploit path
- Issues in the Android OS itself

## Automated dependency scanning

Two GitHub Actions workflows help catch dependency-related issues before
they reach `main`: `dependency-review.yml` flags newly introduced
vulnerable or disallowed-license dependencies on every pull request, and
Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) opens weekly PRs to keep Gradle
dependencies and GitHub Actions versions current. Neither replaces manual
review of security-sensitive changes.

## Security Design Notes

VineOS uses Linux namespaces (PID, mount, UTS, IPC) for guest isolation.
This provides meaningful but not absolute isolation; it is not a
hypervisor. The security model assumes:

1. The host device is not rooted by an attacker (the attacker has normal
   Android app sandbox privileges)
2. The guest ROM image is trusted (downloaded and SHA-256 verified by VineOS)
3. SELinux is enforcing on the host

Root-required features (Magisk inside instances) are opt-in and explicitly
documented as reducing the isolation boundary. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#security-model) for the full threat model.
